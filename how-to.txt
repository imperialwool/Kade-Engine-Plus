--- How to do own boyfriend skin?
- Download bf skin what you like;
- Rename all files like "BOYFRIEND1" (max number is 3);
- Go to XML file and rename in "<TextureAtlas" "imagePath" as you named files;
- Copy that files to "[gamefolder]/assets/shared/images/characters".
! Warning! You should have all files (bfCar, bfChristmas) for working fully, or game can crash!
! Renaming and XML editing proccess are the same - put the number at the end of file.
! "BOYFRIEND0" OR "BOYFRIEND69" WILLN'T WORK AND I WILLN'T DO LOADING ASSETS WITH CUSTOM NAMES PLZ DONT FUNK MY BRAINS AND ME WITH THIS SHEET
